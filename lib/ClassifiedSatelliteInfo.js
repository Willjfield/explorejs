var CanyonInfo = 'Canyon was a series of seven United States spy satellites launched between 1968 and 1977.[1] Also known by its program number AFP-827,[2][3] the satellites were developed with the participation of the Air Force. The Canyon project is credited as being the first American satellite system tasked for COMINT.'

var MagnumInfo = 'Magnum was a class of SIGINT spy satellites reportedly operated by the National Reconnaissance Office for the United States Central Intelligence Agency. The program remains classified, and the information that exists is speculative.'

var VortexInfo = 'Vortex, previously known as Chalet, was a class of spy satellite operated by the United States during the 1980s and 1990s to collect signals intelligence (SIGINT) from high Earth orbit. The Vortex satellites were operated by the National Reconnaissance Office for the United States Air Force and listened to radio transmissions originating from Earth or space. The intercepted data is believed to have been fed into and analyzed by the National Security Agency ECHELON system.'

var RhyoliteInfo = 'Aquacade, previously designated Rhyolite, was a class of SIGINT spy satellites operated by the National Reconnaissance Office for the United States Central Intelligence Agency. The National Security Agency (NSA) was also reportedly involved.[1] The program, also known by SIGAD AFP-720 and SIGAD AFP-472, respectively,[2] is still classified. During the same period, the Canyon SIGNIT satellites were in use with an apparently somewhat different set of capabilities.'

var FLTSATCOMInfo='FLTSATCOM (also FLTSAT) was a satellite communication system of the U.S. Navy which was used for UHF radio communications between ships, submarines, airplanes and ground stations of the Navy.'

var EkranInfo="Ekran (Russian: 'Экран', 'Screen') was a Soviet-Russian type of geostationary satellite, developed for a national system of Direct-To-Home television. The first satellite of Ekran series was launched in 1976. Each satellite in the Ekran series was designed to provide one TV and 2 radio program channels to cable TV systems throughout the USSR and to individual home receivers in northern Siberia. Ekran's downlink is in the UHF range."

var DSCSInfo='The Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS)[1] provides the United States with military communications to support globally distributed military users. DSCS will be replaced by the Wideband Global SATCOM system. A total of 14 DSCS III satellites were launched between the early 1980s and 2003. Two satellites were launched aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis in 1985 during STS-51J. According to the USAF, in early 2008 most of the satellites were still working. DSCS operations are currently run by the 3d Space Operations Squadron out of Schriever AFB.'

var SDSInfo = "The Satellite Data System (SDS) is a system of United States military communications satellites. At least three generations have been used: SDS-1 from 1976 to 1987; SDS-2 from 1989 to 1996; SDS-3 from 1998 to the present. It is believed that these satellites were known by the code name Quasar.[1] The first generation were named simply 'SDS', the second generation were named 'Quasar' and the third generation each carried their own designation names."

var MilstarInfo = 'Milstar, originally meaning Military Strategic and Tactical Relay, is a constellation of military communications satellites in geostationary orbit, which are operated by the United States Air Force, and provide secure and jam-resistant worldwide communications to meet the requirements of the Armed Forces of the United States. Six spacecraft were launched between 1994 and 2003, of which five are operational, and the sixth was lost in a launch failure.'

var TrumpetInfo = 'TRUMPET (also known as JEROBOAM[1]), called Advanced Jumpseat by some observers, is reportedly a series of ELINT reconnaissance satellites launched by the United States during the 1990s to replace the Jumpseat satellites. Speculated to weigh 5,200 kg, three of these satellites were launched into highly elliptical orbits by Titan 4 launch vehicles from Cape Canaveral between 1994 and 1997. Their precise mission and capabilities are classified. News reports state that the satellites monitor radio communication using antennas with diameters of 150 m.[2] It is speculated that the satellites are manufactured by Boeing.'

var MercuryInfo = 'Mercury, also known as Advanced Vortex, was a series of three United States spy satellites launched in the 1990s. These satellites were launched and operated by the National Reconnaissance Office with the participation of the United States Air Force. Two of the three launches from Cape Canaveral were successful, with the third failing to achieve orbit. The satellites collect SIGINT from near-geosynchronous orbits. Their precise mission and capabilities are highly classified, but they are widely believed to be successors to the Vortex/Chalet satellites.'

var MentorInfo = 'Orion, also known as Mentor or Advanced Orion, is a class of United States spy satellites that collect signals intelligence (SIGINT) from space. Operated by the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) and developed with input from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), five have been launched from Cape Canaveral on Titan IV and Delta IV rockets since 1995. These satellites collect radio emissions (SIGINT) from geostationary orbits and act as replacements for the older constellation of Magnum satellites.' 

var SicralInfo = "SICRAL 1B is a communications satellite built by Thales Alenia Space. It is a dual-use spacecraft: Telespazio will use some of the satellite's transmission capacity and some will be used by the Italian defense ministry and NATO. The spacecraft is based on the Italsat 3000 bus and includes one EHF/Ka band, three UHF-band and five active SHF-band transponders. It is designed to be operable for 13 years."

var MitexInfo = 'The Micro-satellite Technology Experiment (MiTEx) is a microsatellite-based mission launched into geosynchronous orbit June 21, 2006 aboard a Delta II rocket. The US Air Force described the mission as a "technology demonstration" for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Navy.'

var WGSInfo = 'The Wideband Global SATCOM system (WGS) is a high capacity satellite communications system planned for use in partnership by the United States Department of Defense (DoD) and the Australian Department of Defence. The system is composed of the Space Segment satellites, the Terminal Segment users and the Control Segment operators.'

var AEHFInfo = 'Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) is a series of communications satellites operated by the United States Air Force Space Command. They will be used to relay secure communications for the Armed Forces of the United States, the British Armed Forces, the Canadian Forces and the Royal Netherlands Armed Forces. The system will consist of six satellites in geostationary orbits, three of which have been launched. AEHF will replace the older Milstar system and will operate at 44 GHz Uplink (EHF band) and 20 GHz Downlink (SHF band).'

var SBIRSInfo = "The Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) is a consolidated system intended to meet the United States' infrared space surveillance needs through the first two to three decades of the 21st century. The SBIRS program is designed to provide key capabilities in the areas of missile warning, missile defense and battlespace characterization."

var MUOSInfo = 'The Mobile User Objective System is a narrowband military communications satellite system that supports a worldwide, multi-Service population of users in the ultra high frequency band. The system provides increased communications capabilities to newer, smaller terminals while still supporting interoperability with legacy terminals. MUOS is designed to support users that require greater mobility, higher bit rates and improved operational availability.'

var GSSAPInfo = 'The two Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program, or GSSAP, satellites have been on orbit since July 2014. They are designed to keep tabs on objects in geosynchronous orbit, a belt of space 36,000 kilometers above the equator that is home to the Pentagon’s critical communications and missile warning satellites. - See more at: http://spacenews.com/u-s-air-force-declares-gssap-surveillance-sats-operational/#sthash.Qw199CE8.dpuf'

var ULAInfo = 'United Launch Alliance launched an Atlas V rocket Tuesday evening, carrying into orbit a classified payload called CLIO for an undisclosed agency of the United States government.
